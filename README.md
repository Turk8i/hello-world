# hello-world

Hi my name is Turki, and I am from Saudi Arabia.

I am a curious programmer who want to try everything even though he knows he cant try them all, but will still try.

Till now I am not sure about what path ill take. Cyber? AI? Web? Game? Software? Still dont know.

I know Basics about some programming languages, like:
- Python
- C++
- SQL
- Git
- HTML
- CSS

And Currently am learning about Github and how to use it since nobody can call them selves a developer when they dont know Github.
